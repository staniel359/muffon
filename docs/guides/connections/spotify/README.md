Connecting your Spotify account to muffon is a fairly complicated task for the non tech-savvy and this document is aimed to make it simpler for them.

# Prerequisites
- **Ensure you are logged in to muffon.** muffon allows you to do certain activities while being anonymous, and this feature is **NOT** one of them.

That's it, that's what you initially need.

# Setting up Spotify to connect with muffon

Integrating Spotify inside muffon has been quite sketchy for us (the devs). Therefore, we've used some complicated methods to help users connect to the platform.

For this, you need to have a developer **ClientID** and **ClientSecret**

This section describes how to generate them.

## Creating a Spotify App
1. **Navigate to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)**
2. **Click on "Create App" button.** The button to be clicked is surrounded by a red box.

3. **Fill the details.** We use a random name for "App Name" field, a random description. Here, I'm using the name "muf" for the "App Name" and the description "Some desc" for the description.

    You should now end up with this

    ```
